/* \brief create spline interpolator.
 *
 * zIPCreateSpring() creates an interpolator \a ip.
 * \a etype1 and \a etype2 are the types of edges at the
 * beginning point and the termination point, respectively.
 * They should be chosen from ZSPLINE_FIX_EDGE and
 * ZSPLINE_FREE_EDGE, which are for fixed-edge and free-edge,
 * respectively.
 * One can set the velocity at each endpoint for \a v1
 * (or \a v2) with choosing ZSPLINE_FIX_EDGE.
 * When ZSPLINE_FREE_EDGE is chosen, \a v1 (or \a v2) is ignored.
 * \return
 * zIPCreate() returns a pointer \a ip when it succeeds
 * to create interpolator, or the null pointer otherwise.
