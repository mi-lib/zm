 * \a c is an offset coefficient vector.
 * \a ans is a vector which the answer is put into.
 * \a iter is the maximum iteration number. Iteration would be
 * done up to \a iter times. When \a iter is zero, Z_MAX_ITER_NUM
 * defined in zm_misc.h is chosen instead.
 *
 * Before calling the function, \a ans should be set for a proper
 * initial vector. An unsuitable initial value would lead to an
 * illegal solution.
 * \sa
 * zCGSolve() returns the obtained minimum value.
