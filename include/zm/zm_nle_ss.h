/*! \brief successive substitution method.
 *
 * zSSSolve() solves an equation \a x=\a f(\a x) by
 * successive substitution method. The iteration will
 * converge when the maximum eigenvalue of the Jacobian
 * matrix of \a f is less than 1.
 * \a iter is the maximum iteration number. If zero is
 * given for \a iter, Z_MAX_ITER_NUM is applied instead.
 * The function forms as \a f(\a x, \a y, \a util),
 * where \a util is a programmer's utility, and the
 * function value is stored into \a y.
 * \return
 * a pointer \a x is returned.
