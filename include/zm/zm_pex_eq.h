/*! \brief numerical solution of polynomial equation.
 *
 * zPexBHDST(), zPexBH() and zPexDKA() solve a polynomial equation
 * \a a=0 based on Bairstow-Hitchcock's method and Durand-Kerner-Aberth's
 * method, respectively.
 *
 * All answers are put into an array pointed by \a ans as complex numbers.
 * \a ans must have enough size.
 * \a tol is a tolerance to terminate iteration.
 * \a iter is the maximum number of iteration. When it runs over \a iter
 * times, it is aborted. If zero is given for \a iter, Z_MAX_ITER_NUM
 * defined in zm_misc.h is used instead.
 * zPexBHDST() is a destructive version of zPexBD(), which destroys \a a
 * in the computation process.
 * \note
 * Since Bairstow-Hitchcock's method is an iteration, zPexBH() may not
 * converge due to bad initialization.
 * zPexDKA() is advantageous to it from this viewpoint.
 * \return
 * zPexBHDST() and zPexBH() return a pointer \a ans if succeeding.
 * Otherwise, the null pointer is returned.
